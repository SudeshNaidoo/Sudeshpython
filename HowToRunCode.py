#How to run and test this code
#First run the Setup.py file. This deletes the previous music.db as it will not run on a new PC
#Check the Testingcodes.py  and unhash the create userid. this will create userid
#Now run the MainProg.py which will require the userid and password just created.

# NB the helloworld.py is part of the original testing and writing code.
